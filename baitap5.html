    <h2 class="a">5. Groups of selectors</h2>
    <p>A comma-separated list of selectors represents the union of all elements selected by each of the individual<br>
        selectors in the list. (A comma is U+002C.) For example, in CSS when several selectors share the same<br>
        declarations, they may be grouped into a comma-separated list. White space may appear before and/or after
        the<br>
        comma.</p>
    <div><br>
        CSS example:<br><br>
        In this example, we condense three rules with identical declarations into one. Thus,
        <br><br>
        <pr>
            h1 { font-family: sans-serif } <br>
            h2 { font-family: sans-serif } <br>
            h3 { font-family: sans-serif } <br>
        </p>
        is equivalent to:
        <p>
            h1, h2, h3 { font-family: sans-serif 
        </p>
        <br>
    </div>
</body>
